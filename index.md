# **K2HDKC DBaaS**
**K2HDKC DBaaS** (Database as a Service for K2HDKC) is a **Database as a Service** that uses [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/) and works with [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) and [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to build a [K2HDKC(K2Hash based Distributed Kvs Cluster)](https://k2hdkc.antpick.ax/index.html) Cluster for distributed KVS.  

We have **two** products for **K2HDKC DBaaS** (Database as a Service for K2HDKC) that cooperates with [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).  

One is **K2HDKC DBaaS** that can be operated from [Trove(Trove is Database as a Service for OpenStack)](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Trove) by incorporating `K2HDKC` as one of the databases managed by [Trove](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Trove).  

The other is a **command line tool** called **K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** (Command Line Interface) that allows you to build up `K2HDKC` cluster directly without using [Trove](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Trove).  

It also provides a **command line tool** called **K2HDKC DBaaS on kubernetes CLI** (Command Line Interface) for building up `K2HDKC` clusters inside [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters.  

**K2HDKC DBaaS** is one of [AntPickax](https://antpick.ax/)'s open source product by Yahoo! JAPAN.
